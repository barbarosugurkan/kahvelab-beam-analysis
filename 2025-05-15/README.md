# ADC Data Analysis: Initial Study

This repository documents my first data analysis project at KAHVELab. The primary goal of this study was to analyze over 200 data points to understand the relationship between PMT (Photomultiplier Tube) squares and ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) values. LLM's were used for the learning features in libraries like matplotlib.

## Project Aim

The main purpose of this initial code and analysis was to:

1.  Gain hands-on experience with scientific data analysis methods.
2.  Develop a foundational understanding of the experimental setup and its physics.
3.  Visualize data using histograms to identify patterns and anomalies.

The following image illustrates the PMT used in the experiment:
