# kahvelab-beam-analysis
This repository contains the data analysis scripts, Jupyter Notebooks, and presentation materials for the beam characterization experiments conducted at KAHVELab. The project aims to analyze and interpret data from our experimental setup.

# ** Key Learnings & Goals **
This project serves as a crucial learning platform, providing hands-on experience in both physics and engineering. My key learning objectives and outcomes from this work include:
- **Data Analysis**: Gaining practical skills in data cleaning, processing, and interpreting raw data to draw meaningful conclusions.
- **Programming Languages and Libraries**: Learning and applying the Python programming language, along with fundamental scientific computing libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and SciPy.
- **Physical Systems and Experimental Design**: Developing a deeper understanding of the physical principles behind our experimental setup (e.g., PMTs, Scintillators, ADCs, Electron Gun, etc.) and the scientific methodology for approaching complex problems.
