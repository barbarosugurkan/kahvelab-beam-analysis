# 2025-07-06 Data Analysis: LEBT Ibsimu Simulation

This README documents the initial data analysis of a beam simulation conducted on July 6, 2025, following a period of hiatus from the lab. This work focuses on processing and visualizing data from an Ibsimu simulation to understand key beam parameters.

## Methodology and Key Learnings

The primary objective of this analysis was to extract and visualize specific beam parameters from a .txt file containing data for 100k particles generated by the Ibsimu simulation program. The raw data was processed using Python, focusing on extracting the **x, x', y, and y'** parameters of the beam.

Throughout this process, the following key concepts and methods were learned and applied:

- **Data Extraction**: The initial work involved programmatically extracting relevant data from a structured .txt file, learning to handle specific data formats.

- **Data Visualization**: Heat maps were created to visualize the beam profiles. x-y, x-x', and y-y' plots were generated to provide insight into the beam's transverse dynamics.

- **Beam Dynamics**: The fundamental concepts of beam emittance and transverse beam dynamics were explored and researched, forming the theoretical basis for the calculations and plots.

- **Twiss Parameters**: Research was conducted on Twiss parameters, which are crucial for characterizing the beam properties.

## Next Steps

The ultimate goal of this project is to simulate our existing beamline at KAHVELab using the knowledge and parameters gained from this analysis. The skills acquired in data extraction and visualization will be instrumental in building a reliable simulation model.
